 * @section openwns_evaluation_introduction Introduction
 * The openWNS Evaluation Framework built on top of the ProbeBus implementation. A short recap
 * of the ProbeBus concept is given here to help you understand the basic concepts. For an in-depth
 * understanding of the evaluation framework you should also make yourself familiar with the ProbeBus
 * framework.
 *
 * - ProbeBus : A ProbeBus may be observed by other ProbeBusses. A ProbeBus forwards the current
 * simulation time, a measurement and context information to its observers. A ProbeBus may accept
 * only a subset of the forwarded information depending on the provided context. In this way tree
 * structures can be realized to sort measurements.
 *
 * - Context : The context of a measurement is additional information that is provided to allow for
 * sorting of measurements, e.g. when measuring SINR values it the context could be the current position
 * of the terminal. In this way the spatial SINR distribution could be evaluated.
 * 
 * - MeasurmentSource : A ProbeBus within your simulator where a measurement originates from and is published
 * to subsequent ProbeBusses. A MeasurementSource has a unique name for identification.
 *
 * @subsection openwns_evaluation_introduction_concepts Concepts
 *
 * The evaluation framework of openWNS is used to build trees of ProbeBusses. The whole evaluation framework
 * is only used during configuration time (in Python). The tree structures are mapped to tress of ProbeBusses
 * at run-time. You will encounter three concepts when working with the evaluation framework.
 *
 * - \pycoshort{openwns.evaluation.TreeNode} : The fundamental concept. Represents a node within a tree. A TreeNode
 * may have a parent and it may have multiple children.
 *
 * - \pycoshort{openwns.evaluation.TreeNodeSet} : Contains several TreeNodes. One TreeNode is only included once.
 *
 * - \pycoshort{openwns.evaluation.generators} : A generator creates new tree nodes.
 *
 * @section openwns_evaluation_quickstart Quickstart
 *
 * The openWNS Evaluation Framework is used to define how measurements are sorted according to their
 * Context. For example, say you have a measurement source 'AssociationEvents' in your simulation model
 * and each station (mobile and base station) provides the MAC.Id context with its own unique MAC-ID.
 * Assume that you want to have a time series for every base station of its association events. Here is
 * how to define this in your configuration by using the openwns evaluation framework.
 *
 * @code
 *  bsIdList = [1, 2]
 *  node = openwns.evaluation.createSourceNode(sim, 'AssociationEvents')
 *  node.appendChildren(Separate(by = 'MAC.Id', forAll = bsIdList, format='MAC_ID%d'))
 *  node.getLeafs().appendChildren(TimeSeries())
 * @endcode
 *
 * @dot
 digraph overview {
   mac1 [label = "MAC_Id == 1"]
   mac2 [label = "MAC_Id == 2"]
   AssociationEvents -> mac1
   AssociationEvents -> mac2
   time1[label = "TimeSeries"]
   time2[label = "TimeSeries"]
   mac1 -> time1
   mac2 -> time2
 }
 * @enddot
 *
 * After your simulation has finished you will find two files in your output directory, which contain
 * the respective time series. The files are named:
 * @code
 * AssociationEvents_MACId1_Log.log.dat
 * AssociationEvents_MACId2_Log.log.dat
 * @endcode
 * 
 * Every file starts with its measurement source name. The Separate generator appends for each ID a suffix
 * according to the format specifier. In this case MACId1 and MACId2 are appended. For historical reasons
 * the TimeSeries generator appends the file suffix 'Log.log.dat'. Suffixes are separated by an underscore
 * character.
 *
 * @section openwns_evaluation_howtos HowTos
 * @subsection openwns_evaluation_howtos_newtree Creating a new evaluation tree
 *
 * To create a new evaluation tree for a measurement source you should first get the appropriate source node.
 *
 * @code
 *  node = openwns.evaluation.createSourceNode(sim, 'SINR')
 * @endcode
 *
 * This will create a new TreeNode and attaches it to the measurement source 'SINR'. If a TreeNode for this
 * measurement source already exists, it will instead return that TreeNode (possibly including all the 
 * child nodes already configured).
 *
 *
 * @subsection openwns_evaluation_howtos_basic_evaluation Basic Evaluation
 *
 * Now lets attach some evaluation to this measurement source.
 *
 * @code
 *  from openwns.evaluation import *
 *  node = openwns.evaluation.createSourceNode(sim, 'SINR')
 *  node.addChildren(Moments())
 * @endcode
 *
 * This will attach an evaluation node to this measurement source that reports basic statistics of ALL
 * measurements. The Moments generator creates exactly one TreeNode which evaluates the basic statistics.
 *
 * @code
 * SINR_Log.dat
 * @endcode
 *
 * @subsection openwns_evaluation_howtos_basic_sorting Basic Sorting
 *
 * Now lets do some sorting. Suppose all your SINR measurements have a context of your stations MAC_ID.
 * We now collect the basic statics for each of your station. In this example we will have 4 Stations
 * with MAC_IDs 1,2,3 and 4.
 *
 * @code
 *  from openwns.evaluation import *
 *  node = openwns.evaluation.createSourceNode(sim, 'SINR')
 *  node.addChildren(Separate(by = 'MAC_ID', forAll = [1,2,3,4], format='MAC_ID%d'))
 *  node.getLeafs().addChildren(Moments())
 * @endcode
 *
 * The Separate generator creates one TreeNode for each entry in the list 'forAll'. Each of these
 * nodes only accepts measurements where the context entry 'MAC_ID' is of the respective value.
 * The getLeafs() method returns a NodeTreeSet of all leafs of the tree. Calling addChildren() on
 * a NodeTreeSet will use the generator to create new nodes for each TreeNode in the TreeNodeSet. Here,
 * 4 TreeNodes that evaluate the basic statistics will be created in total. The resulting tree looks like this.
 * @dot
digraph overview {
   f [shape=plaintext, label = "Filename:"]
   s [shape=plaintext, label = "SINR"]
   m [shape=plaintext, label = "MAC_ID%d"]
   mo [shape=plaintext, label = "Log.dat"]
   mac1 [label = "MAC_Id == 1"]
   mac2 [label = "MAC_Id == 2"]
   mac3 [label = "MAC_Id == 3"]
   mac4 [label = "MAC_Id == 4"]
   SINR -> mac1
   SINR -> mac2
   SINR -> mac3
   SINR -> mac4
   mom1[label = "Moments"]
   mom2[label = "Moments"]
   mom3[label = "Moments"]
   mom4[label = "Moments"]
   mac1 -> mom1
   mac2 -> mom2
   mac3 -> mom3
   mac4 -> mom4
   { rank = same; "s"; "SINR"; }
   { rank = same; "m"; "mac1"; "mac2"; "mac3"; "mac4";}
   { rank = same; "mo"; "mom1"; "mom2"; "mom3"; "mom4";}
   f -> s [color = white]
   s -> m [arrowhead=none, label=" + '_'"]
   m -> mo [arrowhead=none, label=" + '_'"]
 }
 * @enddot
 * You also have some control to the naming of your files. Filenames are constructed by concatenating the
 * format strings of each TreeNode starting from the root node and then going down to the child nodes. For
 * example, the leftmost Moments TreeNode will have a filename which is the concatenation of the format string
 * of the root TreeNode ('SINR', you do not have control on that) and the string 'MAC_ID1' and a string 'Log.dat', which
 * is attached by the Moments TreeNode itself. Each of these parts of the filename are concatenated by an underscore
 * character.
 *
 * After your simulation has finished you will have four files in your output directory which contain
 * the SINR statistics for each station (i.e. for each MAC_ID).
 *
 * @code
 * SINR_MAC_ID1_Log.dat
 * SINR_MAC_ID2_Log.dat
 * SINR_MAC_ID3_Log.dat
 * SINR_MAC_ID4_Log.dat
