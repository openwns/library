    /**
     * @brief Prohibits copy construction and copy assignment for a class "A" if you
     * derive "A" from this class
     *
     * @author Marc Schinnenburg <marc@schinnenburg.com>
     *
     * This has been taken from the documentation of boost::noncopyable:
     *
     * Some objects, particularly those which hold complex resources like files
     * or network connections, have no sensible copy semantics.  Sometimes there
     * are possible copy semantics, but these would be of very limited
     * usefulness and be very difficult to implement correctly.  Sometimes
     * you're implementing a class that doesn't need to be copied just yet and
     * you don't want to take the time to write the appropriate functions.
     * Deriving from NonCopyable will prevent the otherwise implicitly-generated
     * functions (which don't have the proper semantics) from becoming a trap
     * for other programmers.
     *
     * The traditional way to deal with these is to declare a private copy
     * constructor and copy assignment, and then document why this is done.  But
     * deriving from NonCopyable is simpler and clearer, and doesn't require
     * additional documentation.
