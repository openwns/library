	 * @brief Schedules events in real time (if possible ;))
	 *
	 * @author Marc Schinnenburg <marc@schinnenburg.com>
	 *
	 * This version of the EventScheduler will schedule events of a
	 * simulation in real time (if possible). This means it delays the
	 * execution of events until the simulation is in sync with the real
	 * time again. This works of course only, if the simulation can run in
	 * real time anyway (this scheduler can't do some magic ;))
	 *
	 * @note Currently the scheduler will warn if the simulation is more
	 * than 10 ms behind the real time. The accuracy of the scheduler has
	 * been measured to be in the range of +-10 ms. From "man nanosleep"
	 *
	 * The current implementation of nanosleep() is based on the normal
	 * kernel timer mechanism, which has a resolution of 1/HZ s (see
	 * time(7)).  Therefore, nanosleep() pauses always for at least the
	 * specified time, however it can take up to 10 ms longer than specified
	 * until the process becomes runnable again. For the same reason, the
	 * value returned in case of a delivered signal in *rem is usually
	 * rounded to the next larger multiple of 1/HZ s.
	 *
	 * Improvements to lower this are welcome ...
