/**
 * @page schedulerBestPractices Scheduler Best Practices
 *
 * With the WNS scheduler you can schedule anything that is callable
 * in your simulation. A callable can be a function pointer, a function object
 * or anything else that implements the call operator, requires no arguments and
 * has a return value of void. This page shows you how to use boost::bind to
 * create such callables in a uniform way and use the resulting function
 * objects with the scheduler.
 *
 * @section schedulingFreeFunctions Scheduling free functions
 * We will start with a very simple example. Suppose there exists a free
 * function freeFunction within your simulation and you want to schedule calls
 * to this function at later points in time.  The example function we use here
 * looks like this:
 * @include wns.events.scheduler.bestpractices.freeFunction.example
 * Every time it is called it sets a global variable to the value 101. To
 * schedule a call to this function at some later point in (simulation) time
 * you could simply do:
 * @include wns.events.scheduler.bestpractices.bindFreeFunction.example
 * This tells the scheduler to call the function freeFunction after 10 seconds
 * of simulation time have passed. The argument you pass to the scheduleDelay
 * function is a Callable that carries a pointer to freeFunction and the delay
 * after which the call to this function should be made. This is quite simple if you deal with
 * free functions, i.e. functions that do not belong to a class and therefore
 * do not have a context. If you want to schedule calls to member functions
 * (which you probably want to do frequently within an object oriented simulator)
 * you need to be able to tell the scheduler on which object the scheduler should
 * make the call to a member function, you want to bind the function pointer to
 * an instance of an object. This is when you want to use boost::bind. Let us
 * just stick with the last example for a short moment and see how you could use
 * boost::bind to create a Callable for freeFunction.
 * @include wns.events.scheduler.bestpractices.boostBindFreeFunction.example
 * Pretty simple to do that. Simply call boost::bind() and pass the function
 * pointer as the argument. This creates an object that is compatible with
 * wns::events::scheduler::Callable. However, this does not have any immediate
 * benefit for us. We will see later that by using boost::bind we get a
 * consistent syntax for all Callables which greatly improves readability.
 *
 * @section schedulingMemberFunctions Scheduling member functions
 * So let us have a look at member functions now. Suppose you have the following
 * class:
 * @include wns.events.scheduler.bestpractices.classWithCallabck.example
 * The behaviour of ClassWithCallback::callback is pretty much the same as the
 * freeFunction of our last example, but now the scope is not global but limited
 * to the scope of the class instance.
 * @section schedulingMemberFunctionsByPointer Pointer Semantics
 * When we pass an instance of some type to a boost::bind expression it is copied.
 * This is fine and yields the expected results if we work with pointers, but it
 * does not necessarily yield the expected results if you pass your arguments
 * by value (see next section). To schedule a member function of an object where
 * you have a pointer to can be done like this:
 * @include wns.events.scheduler.bestpractices.boostBindMemberFunction.example
 * @section schedulingMemberFunctionsByValue Value Semantics
 * The code below illustrates the usage of boost::bind if you have references to
 * your callback objects. To avoid copying of your callback object when you pass
 * it as an argument to boost::bind, just wrap in an boost::ref or boost::cref
 * (wrapper for const references) object. Thereby, only the reference wrapper is
 * copied but not the reference itself. You could also have simply taken the
 * address (& operator) of your callback object and pass it to boost::bind to
 * enforce pointer semantics.
 * @include wns.events.scheduler.bestpractices.boostBindMemberFunctionRef.example
 * @section schedulingMemberFunctionsArguments Scheduling functions that take aguments
 * The examples above lack a very important feature. None of the above callbacks
 * can take an argument. Most often within your simulation you want to schedule
 * calls that take parameters. Boost::bind offers partial binding of parameters,
 * too. If you bind all parameters in an boost::bind expression, the result is
 * a nullary function object that you can the pass the the scheduler. The follwing
 * example illustrates this:
 * @include wns.events.scheduler.bestpractices.boostBindMemberFunctionParam.example
