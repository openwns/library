     * @brief Finite State Machines for C++
     *
     * A Finite State Machine (FSM) is typically described by the signals it
     * can receive, the variables it holds and possible states it might have
     * at runtime. This template defines an FSM with two parameters: SIGNALS
     * and VARIABLES
     *
     * SIGNALS should be an abstract interface defining the signals the FSM
     * can take. Each signal is represented by a method of the interface.
     *
     * VARIABLES should be a struct/class containing the variables of the
     * FSM.
     *
     * The different states of this FSM are represented by different classes
     * (or better objects of different classes).

/**
 * @page HowToWriteFiniteStateMachine How to write a Finite State Machine
 *
 * A simple example should clarify how to implement a finite state machine based
 * on the wns::fsm::FSM template. A finite state machine for a light control,
 * which switches the light at night on if a movement was detected and switches
 * it off again after a certain timer has elapsed should be designed. The
 * following sections will show the necessary steps to implement the ligt
 * control based on wns::fsm::FSM. The following sub-sections represent the
 * necessary steps:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>@ref FSM_Modelling</li>
 * <li>@ref FSM_SignalInterface</li>
 * <li>@ref FSM_Variables</li>
 * <li>@ref FSM_Interface</li>
 * <li>@ref FSM_Implementation</li>
 * <li>@ref FSM_States</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * @section FSM_Modelling Modelling the FSM Light Control
 *
 * @b Recipe: Find a model which describes the problem based on a finite state
 * machine
 *
 * First of all we need to find a model for the finite state machine. We know
 * that the Lamp Control should turn on the lamp if a movement was detected and
 * if it's currently night. Thinking about this we can derive that we need at
 * least three states for the FSM to represent the different behaviours: Day,
 * Night, LampOn, since the FSM must react different to input if it's day or
 * night and different again, if the light is currently turned on (e.g., at
 * day the light must not be turned on if a movement was detected).
 *
 * At run time the finite state machine will be in one of these three
 * states. Being in these states it needs to react to certain signals (input)
 * with some action. The action may also include a state change (e.g., the
 * finite state machine is in state "Night" and the signal "light" arrives, the
 * state would change to "Day"). The signals needed here are: dark (to switch from
 * Day to Night), light (to switch from Nigth to Day), movementDetcted (to switch the
 * Lamp on) and timerElapsed (to switch the lamp off after some time). With
 * these states and signals, the model of our finite state machine "Lamp Control"
 * looks like this:
 *
 * @dot
 * digraph finite_state_machine {
 *   node [shape = circle, fontname=Helvetica, fontsize=12 ]; Day Night LampOn;
 *   rankdir=LR;
 *   Day -> Night [ label = "dark", fontname=Helvetica, fontsize=9 ]
 *   Day -> Day [ label = "movementDetcted", fontname=Helvetica, fontsize=9 ]
 *   Day -> Day [ label = "light", fontname=Helvetica, fontsize=9 ]
 *   Night -> Night [ label = "dark", fontname=Helvetica, fontsize=9 ]
 *   Night -> Day [ label = "light", fontname=Helvetica, fontsize=9 ]
 *   Night -> LampOn [ label = "movementDetcted", fontname=Helvetica, fontsize=9 ]
 *   LampOn -> Night [ label = "timerElapsed", fontname=Helvetica, fontsize=9 ]
 *   LampOn -> Day [ label = "light", fontname=Helvetica, fontsize=9 ]
 *   LampOn -> LampOn [ label = "movementDetcted", fontname=Helvetica, fontsize=9 ]
 *   LampOn -> LampOn [ label = "dark", fontname=Helvetica, fontsize=9 ]
 * }
 * @enddot
 *
 * Summary of the model:
 * <ol>
 *   <li> It has three states:</li>
 *   <ul>
 *     <li> Day </li>
 *     <li> Night </li>
 *     <li> LampOn </li>
 *   </ul>
 *   <li> It has four signals:</li>
 *   <ul>
 *     <li> light </li>
 *     <li> dark </li>
 *     <li> movementDetected </li>
 *     <li> timerElapsed </li>
 *   </ul>
 * </ol>
 *
 * After this model has been identified it needs to be transfered to C++. The
 * framework provided by wns::fsm::FSM will help us to get the model implemented
 * fast and efficiently. Most of the following steps contain a sentence
 * describing in recipe style what needs to be done.
 *
 *
 * @section FSM_SignalInterface An interface (abstract class) to define the signals
 *
 * @b Recipe: Write a class having all signals of the finite state machine as pure
 * virtual functions.
 *
 * The signals have to be modeled as pure virtual methods of a class. Make sure
 * the class is really an interface (does not contain any variables, is
 * stateless). The States classes will be derived from this
 * interface later. The interface for our signals looks like this:
 *
 * @include "FSM::LightControlSignals.example"
 *
 * @note The copy constructor has been disallowed in order to prevent copying of
 * states. The default constructor is protected: since an interface can't be
 * instantiated the constructor can only be called by a derived class.
 *
 * @section FSM_Variables States share Variables
 *
 * @b Recipe: Write a class containing all the variables of the FSM shared by
 * the different states
 *
 * The finite state machine is also characterized by a set of variables which it
 * holds. All these variables have to be implemented in a struct or class which
 * will be used by the wns::fsm::FSM template later. For simplicity our example
 * assumes the class definig the variables is called "Lamp" and contains only
 * one variable called "on":
 *
 * @include "FSM::Lamp.example"
 *
 * @section FSM_Interface An interface for the FSM "Light Control"
 *
 * @b Recipe: Make a handy typedef to the interface of your FSM
 *
 * The template wns::fsm::FSM instantiated with Variables and Signal will not
 * implement the finite state machine itself. It will provide an interface for
 * the final finite state machine. To have a handy alias create a typedef to
 * this interface with the signal interface from above ("LightControlSignals")
 * and the variables that characterize the finite state machine ("Lamp"):
 *
 * @include "FSM::LightControlInterface.example"
 *
 * @section FSM_Implementation Implementation of the finite state machine
 *
 * @b Recipe: Derive the final implementation from the interface (aliased by the
 * typedef)
 *
 * We're going to use the previously introduced typedef defining our FSM to
 * derive a real implementation of this FSM. All methods of the signal
 * interface ("LightControlSignals") need to be defined here:
 *
 * @include "FSM::LightControl.example"
 *
 * The implementation of the methods forward the method call simply to the
 * current state object:
 *
 * @include "FSM::LightControlMethods.example"
 *
 * @note The constructor must always take a const reference to the type exported
 * as "VariablesType" by the FSM interface ("LightControlInterface", the
 * typedef)
 * @note The constructor must set the FSM to a valid initial state (here Night).
 *
 * @section FSM_States Implementing the behaviour in the different states
 *
 * @b Recipe: Implement a class for each state
 *
 * Each state is represented by a different class. These classes will be
 * instantiated and deleted by the FSM. Here the definition of the states (Day,
 * Night and LampOn) are presented:
 *
 * @include "FSM::Day.example"
 * @include "FSM::Night.example"
 * @include "FSM::LampOn.example"
 *
 * @note All methods from the signal interface must be redefined.
 * @note The state must be derived from an type exported by the interface of the
 * FSM ("Light Control Interface", the typedef) named "StateInterface"
 * @note The constructor must take a pointer to the interface of the FSM
 *
 * The implementation of the methods of these classes looks like this:
 * @include "FSM::DayMethods.example"
 * @include "FSM::NightMethods.example"
 * @include "FSM::LampOnMethods.example"
 *
 * @note: The name of a state is defined by the string used to register the
 * state at the static factory and has to be unique throughout the WNS.
 * This name has to be used also in the constructor of the state.
 *
