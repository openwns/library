	 * @section staticfactoryusing Use StaticFactory
	 *
	 * A StaticFactory provides an easy to use interface for plugin handling.
	 * Plugins register at a StaticFactory in a decentralised fashion through the
	 * use of static, namespace-level objects. That means that at the time your
	 * main function gains control, all plugins have already been registered.
	 * If you choose to dynamically load shared objects that contain plugins, the
	 * plugins get registered during shared object initialisation. There is no
	 * central point where you have to register the plugins by hand.
	 *
	 * By convention, every StaticFactory template instance is typedefed for your
	 * convenience. Assume a collection of plugins that all conform to a given
	 * interface, say TestInterface:
	 *
	 * @include wns.StaticFactory.InterfaceDefinition.example
	 *
	 * Then there are two more types declared to work with:
	 * @li TestFactory, and
	 * @li TestCreator.
	 *
	 * Having these types defined, working with a StaticFactory is pretty simple:
	 *
	 * @include wns.StaticFactory.testSimpleCreation.example
	 *
	 * @section staticfactoryimplementing Write your own plugin
	 *
	 * Each StaticFactory template instance is a static class that serves
	 * as a factory for objects conforming to a specific interface.
	 * The interface includes behaviour, state and signature of the constructor.
	 *
	 * Each StaticFactory defines its interface as an abstract class. For
	 * example the StaticFactory 'TestFactory' could define a class 'TestInterface'.
	 * To write your own plugin, you simply have to write a realisation of
	 * the interface and register your plugin at the StaticFactory:
	 *
	 * @include wns.StaticFactory.InterfaceImplementation.example
	 *
	 * @note Don't forget to register your plugin using STATIC_FACTORY_REGISTER.
	 *
	 * That's all.
	 *
	 * Things get only slightly more difficult, if you want to provide
	 * a plugin for a StaticFactory that requests a constructor with another
	 * signature. As you saw, plugin instances are created using a creator.
	 * For different constructor signatures, you need different creators.
	 * Creators are named loosely after their signature by convention. For example
	 * LongCreator for interfaces that require the constructor to have one
	 * argument of type long, LayerConfigCreator for constructors with
	 * the signature (Layer*, pyconfig::View*).
	 *
	 * Assuming a FunkFactory, that requires its plugin implementations
	 * to have a constructor with a long as single argument, an implementation
	 * could look like:
	 *
	 * @include wns.StaticFactory.Hancock.example
	 *
	 * @note Use STATIC_FACTORY_REGISTER_WITH_CREATOR when writing plugins with a
	 * non-default constructor signature.
	 *
	 * @section staticfactorycreate Raw meat: create your own StaticFactory
	 *
	 * To create your own StaticFactory, you have to provide three things:
	 * @li an interface,
	 * @li a creator, and
	 * @li the factory.
	 *
	 * Defining the interface is simple: just write an abstract class, describing you interface.
	 * Assume, you want to implement several classes that conform to a given interface (that have
	 * some public state/behaviour):
	 * @include wns.StaticFactory.InterfaceDefinition.example
	 *
	 * Second you have to choose a creator. If you are lucky, a creator with
	 * the desired constructor signature already exists. If not, have a look at LongCreator.hpp
	 * or LayerConfigCreator.hpp for examples.
	 *
	 * The only thing left to do is to provide some typedefs for convenience:
	 * @include wns.StaticFactory.Thingies.example
	 *
	 * If you chose to use a different creator than the default creator Creator, you have to
	 * use that instead. Have a look at the complete FunkInterface components for an example
	 * of how to create a factory with a different creator:
	 *
	 * @include wns.StaticFactory.FunkInterface.example
