	/**
	 * @page LayerDevelopmentPage How to implement a Layer
	 *
	 * @section introduction Introduction
	 *
	 * Layer development is often the fundamental step of developing a wns
	 * module. Layers in the wns correspond to ISO OSI Layers and are divided
	 * into functionalUnits. There is a simple machanism to connect functionalUnits
	 * together. These functionalUnits connected in a specific way and assembled in
	 * the Layer class represent the layer of the wns module.
	 *
	 * @section usage Usage
	 *
	 * To define a wns layer it is necessary to derive a class from
	 * wns::ldk::Layer and implement three virtual methods.
	 *
	 * @include Layer:InterfaceDefinition.example
	 *
	 * The two methods doSendData and doOnData are called whenever the layer is
	 * asked to process outgoing compounds (sendData) and incoming compounds (onData).
	 * Typically the function of a layer is quite complex hence a split of the
	 * layer is necessary. The wns library provides a mechanism to easily
	 * build up a layer split into functionalUnits. For this several functionalUnits are
	 * already defined (FunctionalUnit reference).
	 *
	 * If a custom functionalUnit is defined there are minimum requirements to be met:
	 *
	 * The functionalUnit has to be derived from
	 * \li wns::ldk::FunctionalUnit
	 * \li wns::ldk::CommandTypeSpecifier<>
	 * \li wns::ldk::HasReceptor<>
	 * \li wns::ldk::HasConnector<>
	 * \li wns::ldk::HasDeliverer<>
	 *
	 * Further the methods CompoundHandlerInterface::isAccepting(),
	 * CompoundHandlerInterface::sendData(), CompoundHandlerInterface::onData() and
	 * CompoundHandlerInterface::wakeup() need to be implemented which are derived
	 * from the FunctionalUnit which is again derived from the
	 * CompoundHandlerInterface. The class declaration may look like
	 * this:
	 *
	 * @include Layer:FunctionalUnitDeclaration.example
	 *
	 * For further details how to implement a functionalUnit see @ref FunctionalUnitPage.
	 *
	 * Deriving from the FunctionalUnit the method FunctionalUnit::connect() gives access to
	 * the connection mechanism of functionalUnits. Higher functionalUnits may be connected
	 * with lower level functionalUnits. The internal structure of the layer is set up
	 * in the constructor of the layer. Here the functionalUnits are created and
	 * connected.
	 *
	 * @include Layer:ConstructorDefinition.example
	 *
	 * In this example there are four functionalUnits declared. Two stubs are set up
	 * as upper and lower endpoint of the layer. A buffer is part of the
	 * functionalUnit chain to store incoming packets. Note that the buffer needs to be
	 * initialized with a pyconfig::View which tells the buffer the bufferlength.
	 * Last but not least the ExampleFunctionalUnit is part of the layer.
	 *
	 * All four functionalUnits need to be connected. This is done by calling the
	 * connect() method of the highest functionalUnit. The next lower functionalUnit is
	 * given as parameter to the connect() method which returns a pointer of the
	 * lower functionalUnit. This makes connecting functionalUnits easy by calling connect()
	 * from the highest functionalUnit to the lowest.
	 *
	 * Finally the Layer has to direct doSendData() calls to the highest functionalUnit
	 * and doOnData() calls to the lowest functionalUnit in the functionalUnit chain.
	 *
	 * @include Layer:sendDataAndonDataDefinition.example
	 *
	 * Now the layer is ready to use.
