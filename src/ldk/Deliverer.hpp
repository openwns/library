	 *
	 * Deliverer is one of the 5 aspects of a FU (see @ref ldkaspects.) <br>
	 *
	 * Deliverer is an abstract base class describing the interface required for
	 * the implementation of strategies to select a FU to deliver a given
	 * compound to in the incoming data flow. A FU does not select a FU for
	 * compound delivery in the incoming data flow directly. Instead it
	 * delegates the choice to its Deliverer strategy. Besides the strategy for
	 * FU selection, the Deliverer holds the set of FUs the FU is connected to
	 * in the direction of incoming data flows.<br>
	 *
	 * For incoming data flows no inter-FU flow control is needed. This is why
	 * there is no strategy pairing as for outgoing data flows
	 * (Receptor/Connector.)
