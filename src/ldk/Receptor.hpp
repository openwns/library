	 * @brief Receptor scheduling strategy implementation.
	 * @ingroup hasreceptor
	 *
	 * Receptor is one of the 5 aspects of a FU (see @ref ldkaspects.) <br>
	 *
	 * Receptor is the default implementation for strategies to wake up FUs
	 * during compound delivery in the outgoing data flow. A FU does not call
	 * the wakeup method of upper FUs directly. Instead it delegates the task to
	 * its Receptor strategy. Besides the strategy for FU selection, the
	 * Receptor holds the set of FUs the FU is connected to from above for
	 * outgoing data flows. <br>
	 *
	 * In combination with the Connector, Receptor implements the inter-FU flow
	 * control.  Given a FU A having FU B in its connector set. FU B alwas has
	 * FU in its receptor set (see wns::ldk::Connector.)<br>
