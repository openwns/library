 * @section wns.queuingsystem.mm1step2.queue Implementing the Queue
 * A Queue can be filled with jobs. For the time beeing it is only important
 * that a job can be created, stored in a queue, and processed, which means that
 * it leaves the queuing system. The Job class is used in order to create new
 * jobs, which are inserted at the end of the queue with help of the push_back()
 * method of the queue. The jobs within the queue are processed following the
 * first-in-first-out strategy. Jobs arrive with an arrival rate. This is why we
 * store the time when the next job arrives in the delayToNextJob variable. The
 * EventScheduler is used to schedule a call to the generateNewJob function when
 * delayToNextJob has passed. If the new generated job is the only job within
 * the queue it is processed direclty. Notice, that the job still remains within
 * the queue as long as the processing of the job has not finished. In our model
 * the server of the queuing system is represented by the head of the queue. The
 * queue is implemented as a std::list which acts as a container and is able to
 * store objects of our Job class. See how easy this can be done:
 * std::list<Job> queue_;
 * To append jobs at the end of the list/queue, we use the push_back() method. To
 * get the object at the head of the queue we call the front() function. The
 * pop_front() method is used to remove the object at the front of the queue.
 * @include "wns.queuingsystem.Job.hpp.example"
 * @include "wns.queuingsystem.mm1step2.generateNewJob.example"
 *
 * @section wns.queuingsystem.mm1step2.statefuljobs Stateful Jobs
 *
 * Now we want to create some statistic for our queuing system, e.g. we want
 * to compute the sojourn time of a job. Therefore the job has to remember its
 * time when it has been created. In the constructor of the Job class we get
 * the current simulation time, by requesting the current simulation time from
 * the EventScheduler of the simulator.
 *
 * When the job has been processed we can calculate the sojourn time, which is
 * the time a job stayed in the queue. Therefore we take the actual time -
 * again with the assistance of the EventScheduler - and subtract the
 * creation time of the job. The first code snippet shows the Job class and
 * the getter method (getCreationTime()) that is needed in order to retrieve
 * the creation time of the finished job. The second code snippet gives an
 * example for the implmentation of the debug output of the sojourn
 * time. Whenever the queue processes a job, it takes the oldest job of the
 * queue (first-in-first-out strategy) by calling the front method. Afterwards
 * the job is removed from the queue by calling the pop method. Now we use the
 * logger to output the sojourn time. Afterwards the queue continues to
 * process the remaining jobs, if any.
