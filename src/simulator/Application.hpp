         * From: http://www.network-theory.co.uk/docs/gccintro/gccintro_70.html
         *
         * The IEEE-754 standard defines the bit-level behavior of
         * floating-point arithmetic operations on all modern processors. This
         * allows numerical programs to be ported between different platforms
         * with identical results, in principle. In practice, there are often
         * minor variations caused by differences in the order of operations
         * (depending on the compiler and optimization level) but these are
         * generally not significant.
         *
         * However, more noticeable discrepancies can be seen when porting
         * numerical programs between x86 systems and other platforms, because
         * the the x87 floating point unit (FPU) on x86 processors computes
         * results using extended precision internally (the values being
         * converted to double precision only when they are stored to
         * memory). In contrast, processors such as SPARC, PA-RISC, Alpha, MIPS
         * and POWER/PowerPC work with native double-precision values
         * throughout. The differences between these implementations lead to
         * changes in rounding and underflow/overflow behavior, because
         * intermediate values have a greater relative precision and exponent
         * range when computed in extended precision. In particular,
         * comparisons involving extended precision values may fail where the
         * equivalent double precision values would compare equal.
         *
         * To avoid these incompatibilities, the x87 FPU also offers a hardware
         * double-precision rounding mode. In this mode the results of each
         * extended-precision floating-point operation are rounded to double
         * precision in the floating-point registers by the FPU. It is important
         * to note that the rounding only affects the precision, not the
         * exponent range, so the result is a hybrid double-precision format
         * with an extended range of exponents.
         *
         * On BSD systems such as FreeBSD, NetBSD and OpenBSD, the hardware
         * double-precision rounding mode is the default, giving the greatest
         * compatibility with native double precision platforms. On x86
         * GNU/Linux systems the default mode is extended precision (with the
         * aim of providing increased accuracy). To enable the double-precision
         * rounding mode it is necessary to override the default setting on
         * per-process basis using the FLDCW "floating-point load control-word"
         * machine instruction, which will be performed by this method.
