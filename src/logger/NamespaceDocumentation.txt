   @brief Logging subsystem of WNS

   WNS provides a nice logging system that supports Messages with
   priorities. This makes the use of "cout-Logging" obsolete. It works as
   follows:

   <ol>
     <li> Create an empty Message "m"
     <li> Fill "m" with information
     <li> Use a Logger to send Message to MasterLogger
     <ol>
       <li> If the Logger is disabled the Message will be dropped
       <li> If the Logger is enabled the Message is sent to the MasterLogger
       <ol>
         <li> If the MasterLogger is enabled and the priority of the Message is
              higher than the global logging priority the Message is processed
         <li> If the MasterLogger is disabled the Message is dropped
       </ol>
     </ol>
   </ol>

   The logging has some useful features:
   <ol>
     <li> Each Logger can be enabled and disabled
     <li> Message objects may be used like streams
     <li> Supports different MasterLoggers (ConsoleLogger, <em>FileLogger,
          NetLogger, ...</em>)
     <li> The whole logging system can be disabled at compile time by defining
          @c WNS_NO_LOGGING. If the logging system is disabled there is no more runtime
          overhead.
   </ol>

   @section Motivation

   For the development and usage of simulation tools it is
   indispensable to have a mechanism for logging of (debugging)
   information about the current state/actions of the programm. As an
   example consider a mobile station appliying power control to its
   links. You want to see, if your power control works, hence you
   insert the following line in your power control algorithm:

   @code
   class Transmitter {
   public:
	....
	void powerControl()
	{
		...
		std::cout << "Set new power to: " << newPower << " dBm\n";
	}
	...
   };
   @endcode

   Every time the algorithm is executed you will see an output like this:

   @verbatim
   Set new power to: 32 dBm
   Set new power to: 33 dBm
   Set new power to: 34 dBm
   Set new power to: 33 dBm
   @endverbatim

   This is quite nice if you have only few logging messages. But
   with an increasing number of entities logging in such a way a
   number of problems appear:

   <ol>
   <li> You can't see which entity (station) has generated the output.</li>

   <li> The simulation time when the output was generated is often of
     interest.</li>

   <li> You might want to disable certain logging output because it
     bloats your ouput with (at this moment) useless information.</li>

   <li> You need this output only if you're currently debugging your
     simulator. In case your simulating (what you should aim at) this
     output is not only useless, but it slows your simulation
     significantly down. </li>

   <li> You might want to redirect your logging output to something
     different but stdout. </li>
   </ol>

   @section Usage

   Therefore a logging system has been created which tackles all these
   issues. In the following the usage of the system will be explained.

   In order to use the logging service you need to know two things:

   <ol>
   <li> How is the stuff used in C++?</li>

   <li> How is the stuff configured in PyConfig?</li>
   </ol>

   More to come ;)
